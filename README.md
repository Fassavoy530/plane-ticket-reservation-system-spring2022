# NYUSH-Databases-Spring2022-Final-Project

This is a class project for CSCI-SHU 213 Databases. In this project, me and my teammate Ella Xu implemented a plane ticket reservation system as a web-based application using Flask. It allows customers to log in to the system to query and book tickets. The booking agents and airline staff can also assist the booking process and make modifications to the flights respectively. Detailed query cases can be found in `User Cases & Queries.pdf`.
